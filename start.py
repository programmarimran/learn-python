# structured roadmap to learn Python effectively:

# 1. Set Up Your Environment

# Install Python: Download from python.org
# .

# IDE/Editor: Start with VS Code, PyCharm, or Thonny.

# Verify Installation: Open terminal and type:

# python --version

# 2. Learn the Basics

# Focus on these core concepts first:

# Variables and Data Types

# name = "Imran"       # string
# age = 21             # integer
# height = 5.8         # float


# Operators

# Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %

# Comparison: ==, !=, >, <

# Input and Output

# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print("Hello", name)


# Conditionals

# if age >= 18:
#     print("Adult")
# else:
#     print("Minor")


# Loops

# for loop:

# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)


# while loop:

# count = 0
# while count < 5:
#     print(count)
#     count += 1

# 3. Learn Functions

# How to define and call functions:

# def greet(name):
#     return "Hello " + name

# print(greet("Imran"))

# 4. Learn Data Structures

# List

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"]
# print(fruits[0])


# Tuple

# point = (10, 20)


# Dictionary

# student = {"name": "Imran", "age": 21}
# print(student["name"])


# Set

# numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}

# 5. Practice Small Projects

# Start building simple programs:

# Calculator

# Number guessing game

# To-do list app (console-based)

# Simple text-based game

# 6. Explore Modules and Libraries

# Learn to use Python’s built-in libraries:

# math → mathematical operations

# random → random numbers

# datetime → date and time operations

# Later, explore popular libraries:

# pandas, numpy → data handling

# matplotlib, seaborn → plotting

# requests → web requests

# tkinter → GUI

# 7. Practice Regularly

# Solve small problems daily.

# Use platforms like:

# HackerRank

# LeetCode

# Codewars

# 8. Learn Version Control

# Install Git and learn basic commands: git init, git add, git commit, git push.

# Connect your projects to GitHub.

# 9. Optional Next Steps

# OOP: Classes and objects

# File handling

# Exception handling

# Web development (Flask/Django)

# Data analysis (pandas, numpy)

# 💡 Tip: Don’t rush. Spend 2–3 weeks on basics and small projects. Consistency beats speed.
